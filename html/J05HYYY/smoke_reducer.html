First of all Smoke reducer (and stopper) records the distance between two times you are smoking.

Then, it lengthens that time between each cigarette by telling you when to smoke (using an alarm). The idea is it will help you reduce the amount you are likely to smoke.
<br>
If you click the Sleep button, the time that you sleep isn't counted to the time between each alarm.

Smoke Reducer is now available on F-Droid.
