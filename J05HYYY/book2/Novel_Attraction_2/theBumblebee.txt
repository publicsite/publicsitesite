The bumblebee can sting.
(But) the bumblebee generally ignores people.
The bumblebee only stings if agitated.
The bumblebee doesn't think very much, or very hard about things.
The bumblebee avoids conflict.
The bumblebee does it's job and likes to do the job well.
The bumblebee is quite content just bumbling along.

I like the bumblebee.
