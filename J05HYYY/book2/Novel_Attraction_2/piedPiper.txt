One theory is, because the town didn't pay the pied piper the debt he was promised, the children and town suffered as a result. It is unclear whether the pied piper was at fault for the children's deaths. But it is safe to say, that the pied piper was most certainly providing a positive service to the town for removing the rats. The children suffered a fate maybe because the pied piper wasn't paid for his positive service. This suggests mismanagement of the town was a common theme (eg. the town had rats due to mismanagement of the town, the town employed a rat catcher they didn't pay, because of mismanagement of the town, the children were in danger, and the town allowed for the children's deaths, perhaps due to mismanagement of the town, perhaps eventually laying blame on the pied piper, perhaps due to mismanagement of the town).
