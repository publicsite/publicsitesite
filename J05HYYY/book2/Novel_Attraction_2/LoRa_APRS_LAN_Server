==LoRa APRS LAN Server==

LoRa signal is recieved through the antenna to the arduino-compatible MCU.
The arduino-compatible MCU runs the RadioHead library.
Packets from the RadioHead library are forwarded.
Usually these are LoRa packets, and are forwarded over WiFi to the LAN.
It does this using a TCP server running on the node.
Xastir picks up the connection from LAN for graphical display on a computer on the LAN like so [1]:

<interface>
  tcp-device 127.0.0.1 6700 KISS
  callsign YOURCALL-SSID
  tx-ok true
</interface>

If this method of recieving the data fails using xastir, then socat is used to forward the TCP connection to a KISS virtual serial device. [2]
The reference board is to be a TTGO T-Beam V1.1 [3]
