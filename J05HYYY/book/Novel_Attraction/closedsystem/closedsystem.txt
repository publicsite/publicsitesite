A boostrappable system is a closed system that can replicate.
A closed system is different from a bootstrappable system. Unlike a bootstrappable system, it cannot be replicated without external input.
Neither requires the transfer of materials inside of the system.

A closed system needs the following:

Metals: For tools.
Wood: For burning (heat, cooking), for tools (for gardening, for cooking), for charcoal (for furnace).
Seeds. For growing.
Water. For drinking.
Sun/Starlight (although this really cheating). For growing plants, for heat.
Leaves or straw: For thatching.
Mud, and clay: For growing, for pottery (cooking).
Fibre: For making clothes.
Air: For breathing. For growing plants.

Required skillsets are:

Thatching.
Gardening.
Pottery.
Blacksmithing.
