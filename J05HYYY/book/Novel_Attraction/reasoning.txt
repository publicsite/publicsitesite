Lexical Relation: 

Where one object can be replaced with another object to give the same meaning. (is-a, ==) [simple set]
Where one object cannot be substituted for another (is-not-a)
Where two objects are opposites. [set of pairs]
Where some objects are part of an object. (is-part-of) [tree]
Where the object expresses a quantity. (date, time, primatives, (strings such as hot, cold etc.)) [scale]

Deductive reasoning:
x == y
a is a type of x
Therefore a == y

Inductive reasoning:
r --> s, >50% of the time
Therefore all s's are most likely to be produced by r

Abductive reasoning:
r --> s
Therefore it could be r that produced s

Question:

Can the lexical relations somehow be grouped using frequencies?
