Eat less hydrocarbons (fats, oils, alcohols etc.)

if patient smoked and had lung cancer, give patient

1) a breath of extremely cold air (not enough to damage)
2) hold
3) exhale
4) a breath of extremely warm air (not enough to damage)
5) hold
6) exhale

repeat this process, patient will cough lots, and lungs may be deoiled.

take zinc tablets, this apparently helps proteolysis, but does not introduce new hydrocarbons

possibly try v. hot bath

eat plenty of protein
