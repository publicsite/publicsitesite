_Saturday 14th March._

Raked mud lots to break it up. This apparently should be done when the mud is 'half' dry.
Once raked, used back of rake to smooth surface.
Drew small ditches in the mud using a stick, approximately 5x the seed size deep.
Sowed 2 seeds (a little bit apart so they could be seperated), then measured the appropiate distance then sowed 2 more, down the ditch.
The very small seeds needed sprinkling instead. (carrot and spring onion)
Then watered each ditch.
Used the rake, the right way round to gently rake along the ditch (not across the ditch), which ligthly covers the seed.
Planted like this the following:
Chard
Carrot
Beetroot
Spring onion
Spinich

I then decided to sow some in the polytunnel.
Mixed very dry compost with water.
Filled trays.
Made holes 5x seed size with dibber in each.
Sowed 2 seeds per hole.
Gently covered hole.
Planted like this for the following:
Parsely
Lettuce
Rocket
Leaks

Found two pots for Chamomile and St. Johns Wort
Mixed very dry compost with water
Sprinkled a pinch of seed on top
Then sprinkled some dirt on top of that.
