We had to cover some plants from birds.
The peas had to grow up sticks.
The radishes partly got eaten by flea beetle.
Deer ate some of the beans, so we put up a fence around them with CDs tied on to reflect and scare them.
Slugs ate some of the plants a bit, almost had to put down traps.
The lettuces went to seed quickly and as of such we didn't eat as many as we could/should have done.
The spinach got pulled up before we let it go to seed, so we couldn't harvest any seeds.
The rocket grown in the greenhouse first, and then transplanted outside went to seed to quickly, and quicker than the rocket planted straight outside.
Plants need lots of water to make nice big leaves.
The tops can be picked off if they go to seed to early, to encourage the growth of leaves.
Had to make a wigwam for the runnerbeans to climb up.
The flax dried up a bit as not enough water (so did some other plants). And the flax blew over once put outside. It didn't start outdoors and didn't make enough flax to make a decent amount of fibre.
The brocolli got catepillars from butterflies laying eggs.
We did not leave enough pods to go to seed on the broad beans for next year.
The grass cuttings on the potatoes as a mulch fell down some in the rain and exposed some of the potatoes, making bits of them green and inedible.
