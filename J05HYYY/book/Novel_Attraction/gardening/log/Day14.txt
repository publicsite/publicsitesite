Picked rocket, picked a lettuce, picked radish.

Note that the radish plant had gone to seed and also the radishes wern't very big.

The rocket almost went to seed but we picked off where the seed grows to get the leaves to grow bigger instead and to prevent it going bad.

Future picking of remaining rocket and lettuce won't be documented. So long as they don't go to seed, they are ready to eat.
