Day_18__Thursday_6th_August

Picked shallots, and left in the poly tunnel for the mud and outer layers to dry.
Picked St. Johns wort (cut off at base with a knife), and left in the poly tunnel to dry.
Put spearmint and chives and flax outside. (These should have been planted in ground (bar spearmint because invasive), they did not get enough water, as on holiday).
Picked some courgettes, these can be picked from now on or continue to grow into marrows.
Dug up some potatoes (by gently putting fork in below the potatoes and lifting, collecting ALL potatoes, not leaving any so they don't grow again).
