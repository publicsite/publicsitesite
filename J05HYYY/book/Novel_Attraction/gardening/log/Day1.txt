WHAT HAPPENED:

Wore wellington boots.
Prepared the garden by digging and turning over soil using a spade.
Spread compost on top beforehand and also after, using a pitch fork.
Washed tools.
Oiled tools.

NOTES:

Compost was dug into a wheelbarrow and transported by another person.
Took approximately 4 and a half hours. ~1800 ml of water drunk.
This is very hard work.

FURTHER RESEARCH:

It may be worth investigating no-dig gardening due to the great amount of manual labour involved. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-dig_gardening
Maximising distance between plants for maximum crop size is a good idea. It may be worth investigating.DONE
Need to work out greenhouse times.
Need to measure area dug.
