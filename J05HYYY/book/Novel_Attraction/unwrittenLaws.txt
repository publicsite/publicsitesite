__Causing Harm__
No harm shalt be caused by an individual or the group to another individual. If harm is caused by an individual, the group or the victim (but not both) are granted
the ability to cause a lesser or equal harm to the purpetrator.
Indirect harm is counted if the harm is intentional or known before the act is committed.
__Inflicting Will__
Not the group nor an individual shalt inflict their will upon another individual.
If the will of the individual is inflicted by the group, the punishment is the individual getting to decide what the group does eg. by overriding consensus.
That is unless the group is carrying out an act of lesser or equal justice when inflicting the will of the group upon an individual.
__Property__
Property rights are respected by all, and stealing counts towards an act of harm towards the victim.
That said, there is no such thing as intellectual property. Once a concept exchanges hands in an exchange, the recipient becomes the rightful owner of said concept.
This includes all designs and knowledge related to said property, and the same applies for renting property. All knowledge related to said rented property becomes
that of the recipient (although if rented the physical product itself does not).
__Negligence__
An act of negligence by the group counts as an act of harm towards the individual.
__Murder__
An act of murder causes harm to friends and family of the deceased. It is also a direct infliction of harm upon (what was) an alive individual. Both are punishable.
__Animals__
Welfare of animals should be protected. Inflicting harm upon an animal matters to who humans it affects, and can be viewed by law as an act of harm upon them.
The psychological harm upon the human or humans involved varies.
