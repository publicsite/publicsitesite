Originally, I thought it would be good to get rope from the fibres of the lime tree, but now I
believe flax would be the way forward.

Flax has two definate advantages:

1) It can make linen for clothes.
2) It can make linseed oil for treating wooden tools.
3) It might be able to make felt for roofing.
4) It might be able to make a bellow for a furnace.

Fibres can be twisted to produce rope by hanging up the fibres and spinning a weight placed 
at the bottom of the fibres.
