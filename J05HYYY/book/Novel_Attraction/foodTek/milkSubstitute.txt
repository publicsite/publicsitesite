Protein 14.66

50g porridge oats
250g boiling water

grind the oats as small as possible
pour the boiling water on the oats, and immediately put in the freezer to cool
once the mixture has cooled, strain through a cheese cloth
evaporate down by 2/3rds to get a cow's milk alternative (the less/slower the heat the better probably)
where cow's milk is 3.4 protein and 3.6 fat
Note: This lacks 4.2g of lactose (a sugar), so ~4.38g can be added afterwards

_______________________________________________________________

Possibly the oat milk can be further reduced to make a nutritional powder, similar to that of milk powder

_______________________________________________________________

Possibly the oat milk powder can be used in chocolate, either from raw ingredients, or possibly as follows, using dark chocolate

(14/100)/weight_of_dark_chocolate = percentage_of_oat_flour





Notes:

grinding the oats and evaporating made a mixture that tasted like milk, although it was really too thick to be a milk substitute and was more like porridge in texture
