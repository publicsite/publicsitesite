The process involves: pickem chopem chuckem (air-)dryem leaveem heatem moistem cureem

pickem: pick the leaves, very important if you want tea
(air-)dryem: remove any remaining moisture, slow drying better
leaveem: leave for ages //this is where i'd like to buy from
heatem: heat to colour over a low heat, makes flavour more ?coarse?, ?preserves tea better?, !creates hydrocarbons! //skip this for green tea
moistem: remoisten, at point of consumption
cureem: let moisture settle in packet, at point of consumption

The fresher the leaves, and [literal] direction of the process, the better the tea can be, for the reason of:
	Selling you stalk
	Cutting
	Over (or under) cooking
	Fast/Quick drying
	Cleanliness
