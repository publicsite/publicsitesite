//some steps are missing
1) stretch-curd cheese like Halloumi
2) Cut into long very thin 'bars', about the width and length of a snack-sized chocolate bar, and the depth of a few pound coins.
3) smoke the cheese
4) ripen the cheese in refrigerated and dehumidified conditions (not freeze dry as bacteria has to work)
