bit shifting

01111110

we want to flip the xth (5th) bit
so
0111_1_110 << 5 - 1
_1_1100000
inverse
_0_0011111
_0_0011111 >>> 7
0000000_0_
0000_0_000 << 8 - 5
store as A

01111110_ << 5
_110_00000
_110_00000 >>> 5
00000_110_
store as B

_0111_1110 >>> 5 - 1
0000_0111_
0000_0111_ << 5 - 1
_0111_0000
+
A
+
B
=
0111_0_110

We can also set a bit to 1 or 0 this way
0000000_1_ << 8 - 5
and store that as A instead.
