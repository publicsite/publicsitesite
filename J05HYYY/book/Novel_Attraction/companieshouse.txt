THIS WON'T WORK as api will just get a pdf.

load historical accounts
get UKCompaniesHouseRegisteredNumber, EntityCurrentLegalOrRegisteredName, currentCashAtBank, previousCashAtBank, currentNetAssets,previousNetAssets
store
load monthly accounts
get UKCompaniesHouseRegisteredNumber, EntityCurrentLegalOrRegisteredName, currentCashAtBank, previousCashAtBank, currentNetAssets,previousNetAssets
check if a value already exists in database for that company number
if so, overwrite and store
if not, store

get list of company IDs from this generated set.
load list of company IDs from BasicCompanyData

check if each id in basic company data exists in generated set

for the ones that don't, write program using API to get data, baring in mind rate limits.

concat generated list and list from API

you should now have the list.

add up the currentnetassets and currentcashatbank to get currentWorth
add up the previousnetassets and previouscashatbank to get previousWorth

subtract currentWorth from previous worth to get yearlyProfit

sort by yearlyProfit
