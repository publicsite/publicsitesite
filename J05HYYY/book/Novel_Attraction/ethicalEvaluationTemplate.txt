What are the potential advantages;
		people will be able to compile their own software from source code
What are the potential disadvantages;
		people will burn more co2


Do the potential advantages outweigh the potential disadvantages?

Yes

Please state why:

For my information security and entertainment, and for other peoples information security and entertainment it is very good.
The CO2 is little in comparison to the positive gain. The energy used to run can be obtained from renewable sources.

Other people's actions are for them to make only,
And they are to be judged based on their actions alone, not mine.
A definition of a ethical crime is to perform an unethical action with intent.

I believe that I am performing an ethical action on the whole
So it would not be I that may perform any unethical action(s) that may occour as a result of this action,
Therefore I should not be held liable for any actions of others resulting from their use of this object,
Which was designed, on the whole, for ethical purposes, and ethical purposes alone.

Therefore it is right to judge people by their own sins, and not by the sins of others,
and I prey that I can be a good and honest judge, of my own actions,
that is, where it will cause more good to be as such, 'men.
