code point open can get the properties per post code
price paid data can get the min and max building numbers

for each min max building number, we can use match and cleanse from ordnance survey to check the x_coordinates and y_coordinates for min and max (are correct)
we generate numbers from min to max, and assign them to the code point open coordinates, including price paid
then generate an address for the street, town and city using osm
and add the postcodes from code point open
we will get a list of addresses generated under the open government licence
it can then be used in open street map
also we can get the INSPIRE index polygons, and add the price paid to the parcels of land

both are under the open government licence, apart from the address data





interpolation is not good for house numbers ... can use ordance survey api to check start and end numbers as there are > 2000 streets.
