A hackle looks like a comb which you pull the flax fibres through to thin them out (I think).

Instead of a metal or wooden carved hackle, which would be near impossible to make at this stage
of the process, sticks can be driven into the ground and used in a similar way.

Flax can be woven, for bellows driving air into the fire and possibly made into felt for roofing.
