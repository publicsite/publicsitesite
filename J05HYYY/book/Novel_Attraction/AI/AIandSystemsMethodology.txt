In the systems methodology, a model is created and tested, then changed iteratively, with the expectation of each subsequent model
being better than the previous.

Systems Methodology:
1) model system flow
2) analyse system flow (quantify)
3) propose possible/feasible changes
4) create new model
5) imlement model
6) goto step 2

In artificial intelligence, a model is generated, then trained against a dataset. It is then tested independently against a new
data set, and the accuracy is recorded.

Artificial intelligence:
1) model generation
2) training
3) test against trained data/model
4) record accuracy
