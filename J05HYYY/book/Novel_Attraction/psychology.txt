I think what people are hard-wired for is the following:

1) Care of offspring
2) Care of self
3) Care of others in direct contact
4) Care of others not in direct contact
5) Care of other lifeforms in direct contact
6) Care of other lifeforms not in direct contact

Generally this is the case in order of priority, but this order can easily chop and change quite significantly and vary from person to person (and party to party).

What can be said, is that most people agree that a lack of any of those points mentioned is a bad thing.
