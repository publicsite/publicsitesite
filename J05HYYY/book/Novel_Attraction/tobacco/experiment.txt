DONE SO FAR:

tobacco was heated in a frying pan on the lowest heat until dry and slightly darkened for the purpose of attempting to fry off the hydrocarbons for about 5mins.
a piece of apple was added to the tobacco to remoisen it again, and this was placed into packets and sealed.

Drum Gold Tobacco (Mix of Air Dried, Sun Dried, Flue Dried) tobacco showed little to no reduction of tar residues on roach after heating. Possibly would have worked
better if it had been heated for longer and/or at a higher temperature.

NOTES:
*	Instead of apple, an amount of water could be added to the tobacco to remoisten the tobacco.




The process involves: pickem chopem chuckem (air-)dryem leaveem heatem moistem cureem

pickem: pick the leaves, very important if you want tobacco
chopem: mash it up, make flavour stronger
chuckem: leave them somewhere for a while, out of sunlight
(air-)dryem: remove any remaining moisture, slow drying better
leaveem: leave for ages //this is where I'd like to buy from
heatem: heat to colour over a low heat, makes flavour more ?coarse?, ?preserves tea better?, removes hydrocarbons //skip this for green tea
moistem: remoisten, at point of consumption
cureem: let moisture settle in packet, at point of consumption

The fresher the leaves, and [literal] direction of the process, the better the tea can be, for the reason of:
	Selling you stalk
	Cutting
	Over (or under) cooking
	Fast/Quick drying
	Cleanliness
