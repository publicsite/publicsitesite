small purchacing power, can only buy low (quantity * quality)
large purchacing power, can buy high (quantity * quality) and low (quantity * quality)

replace "quality" for "efficiency"

small purchacing power <-> reduction in supply to them
small purchacing power <-> increase in demand from them
large purchacing power <-> increase in supply to them
large purchacing power <-> reduction in demand from them
