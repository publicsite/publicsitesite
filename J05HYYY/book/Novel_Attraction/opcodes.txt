In binutils, there is a folder called opcodes, that has an <architecture>-opc.tbl file that
contains opcodes.

In gcc there is a folder at gcc/config/ that has a <architecture>.md file that contains standard
names used to convert RTL to assembly.

ORISCs that are turing complete and universal:

addition (Addleq), decrement (DJN), increment (P1eq), and subtraction (Subleq). The latter is the oldest, the most popular and, arguably, the most efficient.

All the above need:

load
store
jump
NAND or NOR

MY INSTRUCTIONS:

Conditionals:

if address equals 1
if address equals 0

Instructions:

jump to address
store 1 at address
store 0 at address

INSTRUCTIONS NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT (for example)

MOV
CMP
JZ

.set
.space or .block
