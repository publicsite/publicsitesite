Honey, Lemon, and Oatmeal

    Mix 1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground oatmeal, 1 tablespoon each of honey and lemon.
    Apply on skin and leave it on for 20 minutes.
    Gently, scrub off the mask using wet fingers in circular motions.
    Wash off with lukewarm water and pat dry.
    Follow 3 times a week.

The honey acts as an emulsifier and binder.
The lemon juice acts as a chemical exfoliator.
The oatmeal acts as a dermobraser.

Note: Probably all forms of exfoliation/dermobrasion will eventually cause wrinkles.
