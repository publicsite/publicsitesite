In hospital, I had some of his darkest moments revealed online.
They were soon removed.
When most of the finger print government were in hospital, I decided they too should have some of their darkest secrets shared to the world.
Again, they were soon removed.

FPG:	have they been removed?
FPG:	(attempts to view history, to find the page with their darkest moments on)
	(history has been deleted, as had I's memory of the event)
FPG:	i know what your doing.
I:	Are they still in government?
GVM:	No, not anymore.
FPG:	FPG are getting texts from people in government *1
I:	About what?

I:	Government, are fingerprint government getting texts from undercover FPG agents from within GVM?
GVM:	No.
I:	Good.
