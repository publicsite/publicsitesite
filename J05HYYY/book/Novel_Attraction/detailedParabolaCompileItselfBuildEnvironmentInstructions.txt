1) Make a script to rsync the parabola repository, directory, "sources".

2) Get sources.

3) Make a script to extract pacman sources to a different directory whilst keeping the original source archive.

4) Use pacman PKGBUILD, to make a generic bash script to build pacman with the default compiler (on a different system).
This should install into a user specified directory.

5) Build pacman, and install into the user specified directory.

6) Make a pacman.conf file and makepkg.conf file for compiling (host to host). These should install in the user specified directory. Most
paths need to be changed. (still host to host.)

7) Modify dagpkg package and scripts so that it accepts a pacman.conf and makepkg.conf. Make the script independent of libretools
package. Make sure dagpkg doesn't get rid of source archives or modify the downloaded sources in any way.

8) Run dagpkg on https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/qemu-user-static/ and binfmt-support: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/binfmt-support/
using the pacman we just built and install into the user specified directory.

9) Run dagpkg on crosstool-ng-libre using the pacman we just built and install into the user specified directory.

10) Build a toolchain with crosstool-ng based on parabola versions of packages (eg same glibc version etc).

11) Make a chroot using the packages (qemu-user-static, binfmt-support) we built earlier.

12) Cross compile pacman, and install into the chroot. (host-target)

13) Repeat the processes in the chroot, using cross-compiler. (host-target)

14) Validate.
