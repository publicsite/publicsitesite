We have two sets of numbers:

1 2 3

3 4 6

... and we wish to compare them.

Divide each (higher) digit, from the other (lower) digit.

3/1=3
4/2=2
6/3=2

Times out the answer:

3*2*2 = 12

This gives us a comparison function that can be used with qsort.

The closer the value is to 1, the more similar they are.
