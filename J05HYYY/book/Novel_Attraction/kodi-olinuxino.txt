sunxi kernel has drm https://github.com/linux-sunxi/linux-sunxi/tree/sunxi-3.4/drivers/gpu/drm/mali
mainline doesn't.
mesa uses libdrm, which uses drm and has libEGL
kodi uses libEGL.

we could try writing the old arch linux arm image, which has the correct sunxi kernel.

mesa has software rendering, so we should try that first.

DIDN'T WORK.
